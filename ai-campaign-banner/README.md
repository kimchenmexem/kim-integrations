# AI Campaign Banner Generator

MVP that turns a marketing message into rendered banner ads, with a full element manifest and exportable ZIP package.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router) · TypeScript · Tailwind 4 · Zod · Supabase · Cloudinary · Bannerbear · OpenAI / Anthropic · JSZip

## Getting started

### 1. Create your local env file

`.env.example` is the committed template — it lists every variable the app reads, with empty values. Your real keys live in `.env.local`, which is git-ignored (see [`.gitignore`](./.gitignore)) so secrets never end up in version control.

From the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then open `.env.local` and fill in each value:

| Variable | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `AI_PROVIDER` | Set to `openai` or `anthropic` to pick which model the planner uses. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys> |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | <https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys> |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project → Settings → API → Project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase project → Settings → API → `anon` `public` key |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase project → Settings → API → `service_role` key (server-only — never expose to the browser) |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` / `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` / `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Cloudinary dashboard → Account Details |
| `BANNERBEAR_API_KEY` | Bannerbear → Project → Settings → API key |
| `BANNERBEAR_TEMPLATE_1200x628` / `_1080x1080` / `_1080x1920` | Bannerbear → Templates → copy each template's UID. Create one template per size. |

Only fill in the provider you selected with `AI_PROVIDER` — the other can stay empty.

### 2. Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

> **Never commit `.env.local`.** If you accidentally stage it, `git restore --staged .env.local` and double-check `git status` before pushing.

```

## Conventions

- **All AI output is validated with Zod before use.** Raw model output never touches storage.
- **External clients are lazily initialized** from env vars — the app boots even with empty `.env.local`, but calls fail fast.
- **No keys in code.** See [`.env.example`](./.env.example).
- **Server-only modules** (`src/lib/supabase/server.ts`, `src/lib/supabase/queries.ts`) import `"server-only"` to keep service-role secrets out of the browser bundle.
- **Midjourney is manual.** The app emits prompt packs; humans run them and upload finished assets via the Assets page.

## Status

This is the project skeleton. Business logic in `src/lib/**` is intentionally stubbed; route handlers return HTTP 501 once Zod validation passes. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the intended pipeline.

## Local visual preview

A browser-only preview pipeline lets you see contextual mockup composites before any production renderer is wired. Run:

```bash
npm run preview:all
npm run dev
```

Then open:

- **<http://localhost:3000/visual-preview>** — three contextual ad previews (1200×628, 1080×1080, 1080×1920) with full Element Manifests and visual-selection metadata.
- **<http://localhost:3000/screenshot-tagger>** — assign each platform screenshot a campaign context (stocks / etfs / charts / green_data / general_platform). Saves to `brand-input/Platform screenshot/screenshot-tags.json`.
- **<http://localhost:3000/mockup-calibrator>** — draw the screen rectangle inside each device mockup. Saves to `brand-input/mockup devices/mockup-manifest.json`.

After tagging or calibrating, re-run `npm run preview:mockups && npm run preview:demo` (or `npm run preview:all`) and refresh `/visual-preview`.

See [docs/SCREENSHOT_TAGGING_AND_MOCKUP_CALIBRATION.md](./docs/SCREENSHOT_TAGGING_AND_MOCKUP_CALIBRATION.md) for the full workflow.

## Cloudinary Upload Stage

Once the local visual preview looks right, push the brand assets and composites to Cloudinary so production renderers (Bannerbear later) have stable URLs:

```bash
# 1. Verify credentials (no upload):
npm run cloudinary:check

# 2. Upload everything:
npm run cloudinary:upload-all

# 3. Regenerate the demo so it consumes Cloudinary URLs:
npm run preview:demo

# 4. Open the preview:
npm run dev    # if not already running
open http://localhost:3000/visual-preview
```

Every image element in the demo now carries `delivery_source: "cloudinary"`, `cloudinary_public_id`, and the Cloudinary `secure_url` in `file_url`. The original `local_public_path` is preserved so the same manifest still resolves locally.

See [docs/CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_WORKFLOW.md](./docs/CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_WORKFLOW.md) for details — destination folder layout, idempotency, redaction, and what to do when public_ids change.

## Bannerbear Rendering Stage

Once Cloudinary has the assets and `/visual-preview` looks right, render the demo ads through Bannerbear:

```bash
# 1. Verify creds + that each template has the required layers (no render):
npm run bannerbear:check

# 2. Snapshot what Bannerbear says about each template:
npm run bannerbear:sync-templates

# 3. Render all 3 demo ads:
npm run bannerbear:render-demo

# 4. View the side-by-side comparison:
npm run dev   # if not already running
open http://localhost:3000/bannerbear-preview
```

Each rendered ad's record in `data/bannerbear-render-map.generated.json` carries the modifications sent, the conversion diagnostics, the verbatim Bannerbear response, the final image URL, and a redacted error string on failure. See [docs/BANNERBEAR_RENDER_WORKFLOW.md](./docs/BANNERBEAR_RENDER_WORKFLOW.md) for the full layer contract and template setup checklist.

## Code-Based Renderer Stage

Production renderer for the MVP — works without Bannerbear template setup. Reads the Element Manifest, renders it as positioned HTML/CSS at exact canvas size, and captures a flat PNG via headless Chromium.

```bash
# 1. Have a dev server running:
npm run dev   # if not already

# 2. Capture the 3 demo ads:
npm run render:code-demo
# → public/rendered-ads/demo/{1200x628,1080x1080,1080x1920}.png
# → data/code-render-map.generated.json

# 3. (optional) Upload the final PNGs to Cloudinary:
npm run cloudinary:upload-code-renders

# 4. View the comparison:
open http://localhost:3000/code-render-preview
```

The dev server defaults to port 3000; if you're already running on another port, pass `RENDER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001` (or `--base-url=...`) when invoking `render:code-demo`.

Bannerbear remains optional and supported — see [/bannerbear-preview](http://localhost:3000/bannerbear-preview) and `npm run bannerbear:render-demo`. The code renderer is the default for the MVP. Both renderers read the same Element Manifest. See [docs/CODE_RENDERER_WORKFLOW.md](./docs/CODE_RENDERER_WORKFLOW.md) for the architecture rules and the resolver priority used by the future ZIP exporter.

## Midjourney Manual Workflow

Midjourney is a **manual** human-in-the-loop creative workflow. The system never calls Midjourney; it generates prompt packs, the human runs them, and selected outputs are uploaded back into the app where they become regular image elements with full provenance.

```bash
# 1. Generate the prompt pack (no Midjourney API call):
npm run midjourney:prompts

# 2. Build the reference pack — classifies brand assets for safety and copies
#    per-prompt style references to public/midjourney-reference-pack/:
npm run midjourney:reference-pack

# 3. Open the workflow page:
npm run dev   # if not already running
open http://localhost:3000/midjourney

# 4. For each prompt: copy → drag the recommended references into Midjourney
#    as style refs → run → download → upload via the form. Approve uploads
#    you want to use in the demo.

# 5. Re-run the demo so approved uploads land on the manifest:
npm run preview:demo

# 6. Render the final PNGs:
npm run render:code-demo
```

Approved uploads emit elements with `source: "midjourney_manual_upload"` and a `midjourney` provenance block (prompt_id, upload_id, intended_use, context, approved). Backgrounds replace the brand-input background; up to two decoratives appear as corner accents; the mockup composite stays the primary product visual. See [docs/MIDJOURNEY_MANUAL_WORKFLOW.md](./docs/MIDJOURNEY_MANUAL_WORKFLOW.md) for what Midjourney is allowed/forbidden to generate and the full element-mapping rules.

The reference-pack classifier ensures Midjourney only ever sees safe inputs: it labels brand logos / IBKR logos / mockups / platform screenshots as **avoid**, while backgrounds and clean decoratives become **style references**. Per-prompt picks land in `public/midjourney-reference-pack/<prompt_id>/` for drag-and-drop into Midjourney. See [docs/MIDJOURNEY_REFERENCE_PACK_WORKFLOW.md](./docs/MIDJOURNEY_REFERENCE_PACK_WORKFLOW.md) for the full classification rules.

### Using Midjourney Outputs

After uploading + approving a Midjourney result on `/midjourney`, you can either:

- **Let it default-route.** The demo picks the first approved background / decorative / hero by `intended_use`. Just run `npm run preview:demo`.
- **Assign explicitly.** On the upload card, pick a slot (e.g. *Background — 1080×1080* or *Decorative_1 — all formats*) and click **Assign**. The next `npm run preview:demo` honors the assignment for that specific (format, role) pairing.

Diagnostics:

```bash
npm run midjourney:list-uploads
```

Every Midjourney-source element on the manifest carries a `provenance` block (`generated_by: "midjourney"`, `uploaded_by_user: true`, `manual_workflow: true`) plus the assignment_id + target_element_role when an explicit assignment was used. See [docs/MIDJOURNEY_MANUAL_WORKFLOW.md](./docs/MIDJOURNEY_MANUAL_WORKFLOW.md#assigning-uploads-to-specific-slots) for the full assignment + provenance contract.

## AI Campaign Planner Stage

Replaces the hardcoded demo with an AI-driven campaign planner. The operator submits a brief; the AI proposes concepts (strategy, copy, visual direction, Midjourney prompt packs); the system constructs the per-format Element Manifests deterministically. The Element Manifest stays the source of truth — the AI never decides layouts or coordinates.

```bash
# 1. Generate a campaign with the deterministic mock provider (no API key required):
npm run campaign:generate-mock
# → data/campaigns/{campaign_id}/campaign-plan.json
# → data/campaigns/index.generated.json   (upserted)
# → data/active-campaign.generated.json   (active pointer)

# 2. List campaigns:
npm run campaign:list

# 3. Render the active campaign as PNGs:
npm run dev   # if not already running
RENDER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npm run render:code-campaign
# → public/rendered-ads/campaigns/{campaign_id}/{concept_id}_{format}.png
# → data/campaigns/{campaign_id}/code-render-map.generated.json

# 4. Review in the UI:
open http://localhost:3000/campaign-planner   # operator form (POSTs /api/generate-campaign)
open http://localhost:3000/campaigns           # list of saved plans
open http://localhost:3000/visual-preview      # active campaign in HTML/CSS
open http://localhost:3000/code-render-preview # active campaign side-by-side with rendered PNGs
```

Architecture:
- The AI returns concept stubs (`AICampaignPlanRaw`): names, strategy, copy, target emotion, visual direction, per-concept Midjourney prompts.
- The system runs the existing demo machinery (`pickAssets`, `pickVisualForSpec`, `buildAdSpec`) to construct Element Manifests for every (concept × format) — 1200×628, 1080×1080, 1080×1920.
- All AI output is Zod-validated immediately after the model call. Schema failures are rejected with redacted error messages (`Bearer …`, `api_key=…`, `sk-…` are stripped).
- Three providers via `AI_PROVIDER`: `mock` (default, deterministic, no network), `openai` (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`), `anthropic` (requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).
- The demo flow is untouched: with no active campaign, `/visual-preview` and `/code-render-preview` fall back to `data/demo-campaign.preview.json` and the existing render scripts keep working.

See [docs/AI_CAMPAIGN_PLANNER_WORKFLOW.md](./docs/AI_CAMPAIGN_PLANNER_WORKFLOW.md) for the full schema layering, what the AI is and is not allowed to decide, and the verification steps.
